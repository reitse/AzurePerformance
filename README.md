# AzurePerformance
 Repository for my Azure SQL DB performance files

# Target audience
If you're using Azure SQL Databases or you're planning a migration, this repository is for you.
It contains some files that are referenced in my blogpost series on Azure SQL Database performance. You can find them on https://sqlreitse.home.blog

# Contents
This repository has the main script used to collect my performance metrics in the period of february through august 2022. If you're reading this later, chances are things have changed. I'll try and keep up with the changes but you never know.

# Usage
You're free to use the scripts, they come without warranty and should never be run against a production environment. Especially the SELECT part is a performance killer. 

# Collaboration
If you want to add something to this repository in any constructive way, please do!
